CONFIGURATION FILE
       When launched for the first time, MP4Client will ask for a font directory and a cache directory.

       Font Directory
              Indicates the absolute path to a directory containing a TrueType font repository. In case  this  direc‐
              tory is not specified or does not contain valid TrueType fonts, text will be disabled.

       Cache Directory
              Indicates  the  absolute  path  to  a directory with write access to store files retrieved through HTTP
              downloads. In case this directory is not specified or has no write access HTTP downloads won't work.

NAVIGATION
       Navigation with MP4Client depends on the renderer type (2D or 3D) and also on content - some content may  dis‐
       able user selectable navigation.

VISUAL EXTRACTION OPTIONS
       When used to dump a visual presentation, the client is no longer interactive. All GPAC features are  supported
       during capture, except audio-related ones. The following options can be passed at prompt:

       -bmp [times]
              dumps  the  specified  frames  to BMP format. If no time is specified, capture is made at t=0s. time is
              given in millisecond, as an SMPTE time code or as HH:MM:SS:MS time code. You may specify several  frame
              times by using a dash-separated list of times (eg, '0-10-15').

       -raw [times]
              dumps the specified frames to RAW format. If no time is specified, cpature is made at t=0s.

       -avi start:end
              dumps the specified segment to uncompressed AVI format.

       -fps rate
              specifies frame rate for AVI dumping. Default frame rate is 25.0.

       -size WxH
              specifies frame size for dumping. Default frame size is the scene size.

       -fill  uses fill aspect ratio. By default, the scene aspect ratio is preserved when dumping.

       -show  show window while dumping the content. By default, the window is hidden during capture.

       -2d    forces  usage  of  2D renderer. By default, MP4Client uses the renderer indicated in GPAC configuration
              file.

       -3d    forces usage of 3D renderer. By default, MP4Client uses the renderer indicated  in  GPAC  configuration
              file.

       -quiet removes script message, buffering and downloading status.
